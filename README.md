## About
This framework is the result of a request made by [Teamplace](https://www.teamplace.net/en/). Simultaneously it also served as topic for my bachelor's [thesis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_-vg-Ca4cDReUQ5LTZvWk0zemc). With kind permission of Teamplace the main framework is now released to the public. 

More details on MigrationContainer's background, its use and the underlying container format can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/pawod/migrationcontainer/wiki) or the [thesis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_-vg-Ca4cDReUQ5LTZvWk0zemc) itself.
